Repo for submission of Course project in Getting and Cleaning Data in Coursera from John Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health by Jeff Leek, PhD, Roger D. Peng, PhD, Brian Caffo, PhD

# Overview/Sources
The purpose of this project is to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. we are provided the raw data, that can be found

*run_analysis.R* contain the code used to converge raw data to tidy data.

# Project Instructions
Creat one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
1.  Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.  Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3.  Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.  Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Details on variables, data transformations is explained in CodeBook.md.
